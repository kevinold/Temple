Temple Baptist Church called him to be their Minister of Deiscipleship and Outreach on a part-time basis in January 2003.  He then was brought on full-time in 2004 as the Associate Pastor and was called to be Temple's Senior Pastor in June 2008.</p>

<p>H.D. and Susan have three children - Marie, Reid, and Micah.  They count it a blessing to be able to serve the Lord in such a wonderful church body.  They are constantly amazed by all God is doing through Temple Baptist Church in White House, TN.</p>
